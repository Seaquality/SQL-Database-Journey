**CTE/SUBS | 10-18-23**

This week I have been learning about CTEs, Sub queries, and functions in SQL. The concept of a CTE is very nice and I'm much more fond of it 
rather than Sub Queries. The course I'm currently making my way through is the 70-461 course. It offers a lot of great content and I've learned quite a bit.
This section has also covered pivots, the with clause, and recursive CTEs. Since I am working for an organization I won't be able to post any code I write.
