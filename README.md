# SQL Database Learning Documentation
Documenting my SQL learning journey and other database stuff

**INDEXES AND TRANSACTIONS | 10-25-23**

The next sections I have gone over included indexes and transactions. Since my employment started I've learned quite a bit about database work. This work
has included things like sub-queries, transactions, triggers, and more. So the prior knowledge has helped greatly when coming to understand some of these
topics that we have gone over in the course. Here are some of the sub-topics I've learned:
- Implicit transactions
- Explicit transactions
- Trancount
- Scope and locks
- Isolation levels
- Heaps and Scans
- B-Tree
- Clustered indexes
- Non-clustered indexes
- Filtered indices

**JSON AND MORE XML LEARNING | 10-23-23 week 2**

This week I have learned how to use Bulk Insert and Openrowset. I also learned about schemas and how they allow you to give attribute types to data in XML.
JSON was also included in this week's learning and so far we have gone over the following topics for XML and JSON:
- Primary and Secondary XML Indexes
- JSON & ISJSON
- JSON_VALUE & JSON_QUERY
- JSON_MODIFY
- Convert JSON data into SQL Server Tables
- Convert SQL Server data into JSON

**QUERY AND MANAGE XML DATA | 10-20-23**

Another topic I studied this week is the crossover between XML data and SQL. Most of it has been straightforward and XML seems very simple 
and relatable to prior things I learned while I was in college. Topics learned included the following:
- Attributes
- XML variables and fields
- FOR XML RAW
- FOR XML AUTO
- FOR XML PATH
- FOR XML EXPLICIT



**CTE/SUBS | 10-18-23 week 1**

This week I have been learning about CTEs, Sub queries, and functions in SQL. The concept of a CTE is very nice and I'm much more fond of it 
than Sub Queries. The course I'm currently making my way through is the 70-461 course. It offers a lot of great content and I've learned quite a bit.
This section has also covered pivots, the with clause, and recursive CTEs. Since I work for an organization I won't be able to post any code I write.
