Documenting my SQL learning journey and other database stuff

**QUERY AND MANAGE XML DATA | 10-20-23**

Another topic I studied this week is the crossover between XML data and SQL. Most of it has been straightforward and XML seems very simple 
and relateable to prior things I learned while I was in college. The SubTopics I have gone over are Attributes, XML variables and fields, FOR XML RAW, AUTO, PATH, and, EXPLICIT.


**CTE/SUBS | 10-18-23**

This week I have been learning about CTEs, Sub queries, and functions in SQL. The concept of a CTE is very nice and I'm much more fond of it 
than Sub Queries. The course I'm currently making my way through is the 70-461 course. It offers a lot of great content and I've learned quite a bit.
This section has also covered pivots, the with clause, and recursive CTEs. Since I work for an organization I won't be able to post any code I write.
